<H2>Mission</H2>
Helping users building their data symphony with Snowflake and Snowpark




<H2> Snowpark </H2>


Snowpark is a unified data processing engine. It allows to manipulate DataFrames similarly to Pandas or PySpark. 

Snowpark DataFrames are lazily evaluated, which means that operations are only executed when they are needed. This can improve performance, especially for large datasets. Additionally, Snowpark supports User-Defined Functions (UDFs), which allow users to transform data using custom logic. This can be useful for tasks that are not supported by the built-in Snowpark functions.

Outline:
- Creating a session
- Loading data into a DataFrame
- Performing common operations on DataFrames
- Writing a DataFrame into a Snowflake Dataset



<H2> Notes to Remember </H2>


<H3> Data Movement </H3>

- Required data formats: Snowflake supports various data formats for ingestion, including CSV, JSON, Avro, Parquet, ORC, and XML

- To troubleshoot data ingestion issues, you can use the following methods: 
    Check the Snowflake logs for any errors or warnings. 
    Verify the data format and structure. 
    Ensure the correct file format is being used

<H3> Performance Optimization </H3>

- Analyze the query execution plan using the EXPLAIN command
- Avoid full table scans, using appropriate data types, and indexing
